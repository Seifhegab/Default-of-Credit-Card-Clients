# Default-of-Credit-Card-Clients

It is Python project from kaggle ,This dataset contains information on default payments, demographic factors, credit data, history of payment, and bill statements of credit card clients in Taiwan from April 2005 to September 2005. The data is analysed ,cleaned, and make some plots to make data exploration and used some Machine learning algorithms.  

the project is divided in to four parts  
1) Data Exploration:

2) Data Cleaning:  
we make some data cleaning as we group all data unknown and data of other in csv in one category to make it easy to unedrstand and make encoding to the data by one hot encoding and make standard scaler to the data.  
3) AI models  
There are more than one models are applied in this project like simple machine learning as logistic regeression and ensemble model as random forest and Gradient boost model and also decision tree model.  
and this is the accuracy and F1-Score for every model:
